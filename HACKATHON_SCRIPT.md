---

## [SLIDE 2: What to Expect] (0:30 - 1:30)

**Presenter:**
> "So, what exactly is this hackathon about? Here's the core mission:"

> "You'll be building AI solutions that address **real business problems** using Anthropic's Claude tools. We're not looking for toy projects or hypothetical demos. We want solutions that could actually be adopted by real companies."

> "Some examples of what teams have built in similar hackathons include:"
> - "Automating customer feedback analysis to help businesses understand their customers better"
> - "Summarizing internal reports to save executives hours of reading time"
> - "Building AI copilots for specific departments like HR, marketing, or operations"
> - "Streamlining data workflows to eliminate repetitive manual tasks"

> "The key here is **impact, creativity, and practical applications**. Your solution should solve a problem that businesses actually face."

---

## [SLIDE 3: Schedule Overview] (1:30 - 2:30)

**Presenter:**
> "Let's talk about the schedule. Here's how the next 24 hours will unfold:"

**Saturday, November 8 (TODAY!):**
> - "**Right now (11:00 AM - 1:00 PM):** You should have already completed your online check-in. If you haven't, please do so immediately after this ceremony."
> - "**1:20 PM:** The moment this ceremony ends, the clock starts! Hacking officially begins."
> - "You'll have all afternoon, all night if you want, and all morning tomorrow to build."

**Sunday, November 9:**

---

## [SLIDE 4: Important Links & Resources] (2:30 - 3:30)

**Presenter:**
> "Before we go further, let me give you the most important links you'll need. Please pull out your phones and write these down or bookmark them:"

> "**GroupMe:** This is your lifeline for the next 24 hours. Join our GroupMe at [linktr.ee/riceclaudebuilders]. Every announcement, every update, every answer to your questions will happen there first. If something changes, you'll hear it on GroupMe."

> "**Devpost:** Your submission portal is at [claude-act-hackathon.devpost.com]. You must submit through Devpost before 1:00 PM tomorrow."

> "**Claude API Credits:** If you haven't already applied for free Claude API credits, do it NOW. The form is on our LinkTree. It can take 2-3 days to process, but many of you should already have them if you applied early. For the meeting field, put down 9/29/2025."

> "**Claude Documentation:** The official Claude API documentation is at [anthropic.com/learn/build-with-claude]. We also have workshop videos from Alex Notov covering Claude Code, Building Agents, and Building with MCP - all linked on our LinkTree."

---

## [SLIDE 5: Teams & Registration] (3:30 - 4:15)

**Presenter:**
> "Now let's talk about teams:"

> "You can work **solo or in teams of up to 4 people**. If you don't have a team yet, don't panic! We'll give you a few minutes after this presentation to network and form teams."

> "**Important:** You must be registered with the Claude Builder Club to participate. If you somehow slipped through without registering, please come see us immediately after this ceremony."

> "Remember: One submission per team on Devpost."

---

## [SLIDE 6: Rules - The Must-Knows] (4:15 - 5:30)

**Presenter:**
> "Alright, let's cover the rules. These are important to keep things fair for everyone:"

> "**Rule #1: No pre-work.** This is crucial. All coding, design, and development must begin AFTER 1:20 PM today when we officially start. That means no GitHub commits, no code written beforehand, nothing. We want everyone starting from the same line."

> "**That said:** You CAN use pre-existing resources like public APIs, open-source libraries, or datasets, as long as they're available to everyone. If you found it on GitHub or npm, you can use it. Just don't write your project code beforehand."

> "**Rule #2: Respect deadlines.** Submissions must be in before 1:00 PM tomorrow. If you submit at 1:01 PM, it's too late. Plan accordingly."

> "**Rule #3: Code of conduct.** Be respectful, collaborative, and inclusive. This should go without saying, but harassment or discrimination of any kind will not be tolerated. We want everyone to feel safe and welcome here."

> "**Rule #4: Ownership.** You retain all rights to your code and ideas. By submitting, you're just giving us permission to demo your project and use it for judging purposes. Your IP stays yours."

---

## [SLIDE 7: Submission Requirements] (5:30 - 7:00)

**Presenter:**
> "When you submit tomorrow, here's what we need from you. Write this down:"

**Required:**
> 1. "**GitHub Repository Link** (or similar code repository)"
> 2. "**Demo Video** - This is critical! 2 to 3 minutes long."
> 3. "**Project Description** - Explain your goal, technologies used, and business value"
> 4. "**Team Member List** - So we know who to give prizes to!"

> "Let me spend a minute on the demo video because this is really important. Here's the structure we recommend:"

> - "**30 seconds:** Intro - Project name, team members, and problem statement"
> - "**1 minute:** Demo of your product in action - SHOW, don't just tell"
> - "**30 seconds:** Technical overview - What did you build with?"
> - "**30 seconds:** Real-world impact and next steps"

> "The video doesn't need to be Hollywood quality, but it needs to be clear and show your product working. Judges will watch these videos, so make them count!"

---

## [SLIDE 8: Judging Criteria] (7:00 - 9:00)

**Presenter:**
> "Now, how will you be judged? There are five main criteria, and I want to be crystal clear about what we're looking for:"

**1. Impact & Relevance (MOST IMPORTANT)**
> "Does your project address a clear business challenge? Does it have meaningful potential for adoption? We're looking for solutions to problems that companies ACTUALLY face, not hypothetical scenarios. Show us you understand the need, why it matters, and how it would be used in practice."

**2. Creativity**
> "We want ideas that feel fresh. This could be a completely new idea, or a distinctive take on an existing one. Show us something that makes judges think, 'Wow, I haven't seen it done quite like that before.'"

**3. Technical Execution**
> "Does it actually work? How much care went into building it? Here's the good news: your project doesn't have to be massive to score well. It just needs to be built with intention. A working prototype with solid implementation will beat a half-finished ambitious project every time."

**4. Presentation Clarity**
> "Can you explain your project clearly? The best submissions guide judges through the problem, the solution, and the demo without confusion. Clear communication, helpful visuals, and a structured walkthrough make a huge difference."

**5. Best Use of Claude (BONUS)**
> "This is a bonus category that rewards thoughtful integration of Claude. Whether Claude powers a core feature, speeds up your development, or enhances the user experience - we want to see intentional and skillful use, not just a Claude chatbot tacked on at the end."

> "You can find a detailed rubric in the handbook and on Devpost if you want more specifics."

## [SLIDE 9: Prizes] (9:00 - 10:30)

**Presenter:**
> "Now, let's talk about everyone's favorite topic: PRIZES!"

*[Show prize slide with swag images]*

**🏆 First Place:**
> "**$200 Gift Card** per team (split among members), **$250 in Claude API Credits** per team, PLUS **Anthropic Swag Bags** for each team member. That includes hats, tote bags, stickers, and more!"

**🥈 Second Place:**
> "**$100 Gift Card** per team, **$125 in Claude API Credits** per team, PLUS **Anthropic Swag Bags** for each team member."

**🥉 Third Place:**
> "**$125 in Claude API Credits** per team, PLUS **Anthropic Swag Bags** for each team member."

> "Important note: Cash and API credit prizes are awarded per TEAM and will be split evenly among members. So if you have a 4-person team that wins first place, that's $50 per person plus the team's API credits divided up."

> "We'll contact winning teams directly after the ceremony to coordinate digital prize delivery."

---

## [SLIDE 10: Tips for Success] (10:30 - 12:00)

**Presenter:**
> "Alright, before we release you to start building, here are some pro tips from people who've done this before:"

**Tip #1: Start Simple**
> "You have 24 hours, not 24 weeks. Start with a simple MVP (minimum viable product) that solves one problem really well. You can always add features if you have time, but you can't submit an unfinished project."

**Tip #2: Demo Early, Demo Often**
> "Don't wait until tomorrow morning to record your demo video. Do practice runs tonight. You'll discover bugs, realize things are unclear, and have time to fix them."

**Tip #3: Focus on the Problem**
> "Judges care more about the problem you're solving than the technology you're using. Start with the pain point, then figure out the solution. Not the other way around."

**Tip #4: Use Claude... A Lot**
> "You have free API credits. Use them! Claude Code can help you build faster. Claude can help you debug, write documentation, even help structure your presentation. This is a hackathon about building WITH Claude - take advantage of it."

**Tip #5: Sleep (Maybe)**
> "All-nighters are romantic but usually counterproductive. Consider getting at least a few hours of sleep. Fresh eyes find bugs that tired eyes miss."

**Tip #6: Time Management**
> "Work backwards from 1:00 PM tomorrow. Leave at least 2 hours for documentation, video recording, and Devpost submission. Things always take longer than you think."

## [SLIDE 11: Food & Logistics] (12:00 - 12:30)

**Presenter:**
> "Quick logistics notes:"

> "**Food:** We have snacks and juice available for you right now. Tomorrow at the closing ceremony, we'll have boba for all competitors who checked in. Stay hydrated, stay fed, stay focused."

> "**Workspace:** You're welcome to work anywhere on campus. Find a spot that works for your team - whether that's here in Kraft, a library, your dorm, wherever you're most productive."

> "**Questions:** Got questions during the hackathon? Ask in the GroupMe. Our organizers will be monitoring and answering throughout the event."

> "**Internet:** Make sure you have reliable internet access wherever you're working. Test your connection before you get too deep into coding."

---

## [SLIDE 12: FAQ Speed Round] (12:30 - 13:30)

**Presenter:**
> "Let me rapid-fire answer some common questions we always get:"

> **Q: "Do I need prior experience with Claude or AI?"**
> "Nope! This hackathon is beginner-friendly. You'll learn as you build."

> **Q: "Do I need to use advanced Claude tools?"**
> "Absolutely not. 'Vibe coding' with Claude is perfectly fine. Use whatever level of Claude tools makes sense for your project."

> **Q: "Can I use other AI tools besides Claude?"**
> "Yes, but Claude should play a meaningful role in your project."

> **Q: "What if my code doesn't work perfectly?"**
> "That's okay! Judges understand this is a 24-hour sprint. Show what you built, acknowledge limitations, and explain what you'd do with more time."

> **Q: "Can I change teams after starting?"**
> "Please don't. Form your final team before you begin coding."

---

## [SLIDE 13: The Devpost Submission Process] (13:30 - 14:30)

**Presenter:**
> "Let me walk you through the Devpost submission process so there's no confusion tomorrow:"

**Step 1:**
> "Go to [claude-act-hackathon.devpost.com] and click 'Submit' or 'Enter Submission'."

**Step 2:**
> "Fill out all required fields: Project title, tagline, description, team members."

**Step 3:**
> "Upload your demo video. It can be hosted on YouTube, Vimeo, or Loom - just paste the link."

**Step 4:**
> "Add your GitHub repository link."

**Step 5:**
> "Write your project description explaining the goal, technologies, and business value."

**Step 6:**
> "Click SUBMIT before 1:00 PM tomorrow!"

> "Pro tip: You can create a draft submission and keep editing it. Just make sure you hit that final submit button before the deadline."

---

## [SLIDE 14: Inspiration & Examples] (14:30 - 15:30)

**Presenter:**
> "Need some inspiration? Let me share a few directions teams often take:"

**The Automation Play:**
> "Find a repetitive business task that wastes hours every week. Customer service responses, data entry, report generation, email triage. Build a Claude-powered solution that automates it."

**The Analysis Tool:**
> "Businesses drown in data but starve for insights. Build something that analyzes customer feedback, sales data, user behavior, or market trends and surfaces actionable intelligence."

**The Department Copilot:**
> "Pick a department - HR, Marketing, Sales, Operations - and build an AI assistant specifically tailored to their workflows. HR copilot that drafts job descriptions? Marketing copilot that writes campaign briefs? The possibilities are endless."

**The Integration Solution:**
> "Many businesses use 10+ different tools that don't talk to each other. Build something that connects them, using Claude to translate between systems or intelligently route information."

> "These are just starting points. The best projects will be ones YOU'RE passionate about."

---

## [SLIDE 15: Code of Conduct Reminder] (15:30 - 16:00)

**Presenter:**
> "One more serious note before we start:"

> "This event is about collaboration, learning, and creativity. Everyone here should feel safe, respected, and valued."

> "If you experience or witness any harassment, discrimination, or behavior that makes someone uncomfortable, please report it immediately to any organizer. You can also DM us privately on GroupMe."

> "We have a zero-tolerance policy for harassment. Let's keep this environment positive and inclusive for everyone."

---

## [SLIDE 16: Final Reminders] (16:00 - 17:00)

**Presenter:**
> "Okay, we're almost ready to start! Final checklist:"

> "✅ **Joined GroupMe?** Do it now if you haven't."

> "✅ **Completed online check-in?** Required to be eligible for prizes."

> "✅ **Have your team formed?** Last chance to find teammates."

> "✅ **Applied for Claude API credits?** If not, apply immediately but know it might take time."

> "✅ **Bookmarked Devpost?** You'll need it tomorrow."

> "✅ **Have your laptop charged?** And bring chargers!"

---

## [SLIDE 17: Team Formation Time] (17:00 - 18:00)

**Presenter:**
> "Alright, if you don't have a team yet, we're going to take 5 minutes right now for team formation."

> "If you're looking for teammates, stand up! Tell people:"
> - "Your name"
> - "Your skills (coding, design, business, etc.)"
> - "What you're interested in building"

> "If you already have a team, use this time to start brainstorming ideas. Don't start coding yet - just ideas!"

> "Some of you will be coding for the first time with Claude. Some of you are Claude veterans. Some of you will stay up all night. Some of you will take breaks. All of that is totally fine."

> "What matters is that you're here, you're going to learn something, and you're going to create something."

> "Remember: This isn't about building the most technically complex project. It's about building something that solves a real problem in a creative way. Focus on impact."

> "The judges want to see projects that make them say, 'Wow, I wish my company had this.' Give them that feeling."
