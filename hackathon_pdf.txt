FAQ
 
What
 
is
 
the
 
theme
 
of
 
this
 
hackathon?
 
Teams
 
will
 
build
 
AI
 
solutions
 
that
 
address
 
real
 
business
 
problems
 
using
 
Anthropic’s
 
Claude
 
tools.
 
Focus
 
on
 
impact,
 
creativity,
 
and
 
practical
 
applications.
 
Some
 
examples
 
include:
 
●
 
Automating
 
customer
 
feedback
 
analysis
 
●
 
Summarizing
 
internal
 
reports
 
●
 
Building
 
AI
 
copilots
 
for
 
speciﬁc
 
departments
 
(HR,

ops)
 
●
 
Streamlining
 
data
 
workﬂows
 
Do
 
I
 
need
 
a
 
team?
 
No!
 
You
 
can
 
join
 
solo,
 
or
 
in
 
teams
 
of
 
up
 
to
 
4.
 
Do
 
I
 
need
 
prior
 
experience
 
with
 
Claude
 
or
 
AI?
 
Not
 
at
 
all
 
—
 
the
 
hackathon
 
is
 
beginner-friendly.
 
You’ll
 
learn
 
as
 
you
 
build.
 
Do
 
I
 
need
 
to
 
use
 
advanced
 
Claude
 
tools?
 
Nope!
 
You
 
don’t
 
need
 
to
 
use
 
complex
 
Claude
 
features,
 
“vibe
 
coding”
 
with
 
Claude
 
itself
 
is
 
perfectly
 
ﬁne.
 
Judges
 
will
 
consider
 
creativity
 
and
 
how
 
you
 
use
 
Claude,
 
but
 
there’s
 
no
 
expectation
 
to
 
tackle
 
advanced
 
technical
 
features.
 
Will
 
there
 
be
 
food?
 
Yes!
 
Snacks
 
and
 
juice
 
will
 
be
 
available
 
at
 
the
 
opening
 
ceremony,
 
and
 
boba
 
will
 
be
 
provided
 
at
 
the
 
closing
 
ceremony
 
for
 
competitors
 
who
 
checked
 
in.
 
Is
 
there
 
a
 
code
 
of
 
conduct?
 
Yes,
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
form
 
you
 
must
 
agree
 
to
 
in
 
the
 
sign
 
up
 
form.
 
Be
 
respectful,
 
collaborative,
 
and
 
inclusive.
 
Harassment
 
or
 
discrimination
 
of
 
any
 
kind
 
will
 
not
 
be
 
tolerated.

Judging
 
Guidelines
 
Impact
 
&
 
Relevance
 
Projects
 
should
 
address
 
a
 
clear
 
business
 
challenge
 
with
 
meaningful
 
potential
 
for
 
adoption.
 
Judges
 
will
 
look
 
for
 
solutions
 
that
 
solve
 
a
 
problem
 
companies
 
actually
 
face,
 
rather
 
than
 
hypothetical
 
or
 
low-value
 
scenarios.
 
Strong
 
entries
 
show
 
a
 
solid
 
understanding
 
of
 
the
 
need,
 
articulate
 
why
 
it
 
matters,
 
and
 
demonstrate
 
how
 
the
 
solution
 
could
 
be
 
used
 
in
 
practice.
 
Creativity
 
We
 
want
 
ideas
 
that
 
feel
 
fresh.
 
This
 
could
 
be
 
a
 
new
 
idea
 
or
 
a
 
distinctive
 
take
 
on
 
an
 
existing
 
one.
 
A
 
strong
 
project
 
shows
 
thoughtful
 
creativity
 
in
 
the
 
approach,
 
execution,
 
or
 
use
 
of
 
tools,
 
something
 
that
 
makes
 
the
 
judges
 
say,
 
“I
 
haven’t
 
seen
 
it
 
done
 
quite
 
like
 
that.”
 
Technical
 
Execution
 
Judges
 
will
 
assess
 
how
 
well
 
the
 
solution
 
works
 
and
 
how
 
much
 
care
 
went
 
into
 
building
 
it.
 
A
 
project
 
doesn’t
 
have
 
to
 
be
 
massive
 
to
 
score
 
well—it
 
just
 
needs
 
to
 
be
 
built
 
with
 
intention.
 
Effective
 
prototypes,
 
solid
 
implementation
 
choices,
 
and
 
evidence
 
of
 
real
 
functionality
 
will
 
stand
 
out.
 
Presentation
 
Clarity
 
Your
 
explanation
 
should
 
be
 
easy
 
to
 
follow
 
and
 
well-organized.
 
The
 
best
 
submissions
 
guide
 
judges
 
through
 
the
 
problem,
 
the
 
solution,
 
and
 
the
 
demonstration
 
without
 
confusion.
 
Clear
 
communication,
 
helpful
 
visuals,
 
and
 
a
 
structured
 
walkthrough
 
make
 
a
 
big
 
difference.
 
Best
 
Use
 
of
 
Claude
 
(Bonus)
 
This
 
category
 
rewards
 
teams
 
that
 
integrate
 
Claude
 
in
 
a
 
thoughtful
 
or
 
inventive
 
way.
 
Whether
 
it
 
powers
 
a
 
feature,
 
speeds
 
up
 
development,
 
or
 
meaningfully
 
enhances
 
the
 
user
 
experience,
 
we’re
 
looking
 
for
 
intentional
 
and
 
skillful
 
use
 
of
 
the
 
tool
 
rather
 
than
 
a
 
simple
 
add-on.
